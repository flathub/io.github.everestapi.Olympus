# Olympus - Celeste Mod Manager

## Notes

This flatpak requires `talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak` in order to launch Celeste outside of the flatpak sandbox. You can remove this permission to improve the sandboxing however you won't be able to launch celeste directly from Olympus.

## Known issues

- The `extra-data` download in Olympus settings doesn't work
- The builtin updater doesn't take into account that it's inside a flatpak
